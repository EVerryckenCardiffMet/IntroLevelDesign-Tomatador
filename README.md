# Introduction to Level Design and Game Asset Creation - Tomatador (Tank Game)

I had a lot of problems with uploading my project to Github. I was never able to push because of file size errors. I had already uploaded my report on Moodle containing the link to this Github repo, but you can find my project in this Onedrive folder: https://outlookuwicac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/st20211109_outlook_cardiffmet_ac_uk/EipZQGnCodNJsGzsfz4_RTQBalYDpmA9P2pR1yay6x1y-A?e=xHJhnG

As an exchange student who usually studies software development, this was my first time doing something video game related. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy what I made!

Some explanation on how my submission is structured:
- the "Audio" folder contains my Audacity files for my sound effects and the .wav files for my sound effects and background music
- the "Exported Models" folder contains the .fbx files of all my models to be used in the Unity project
- the "Modelling" folder contains all 3DS Max files, texture maps and textures for all my assets
- the "Presentation" folder contains the presentation slides and presentation video
- the "Tank Game 2021" folder is my Unity project
- the "st20211109" file is the same conceptual design file that I submitted on Moodle
- the "tank_animated.fbx" file is my textured and animated tank model

# Introduction to Level Design and Game Asset Creation - Tomatador (Tank Game)

As an exchange student who usually studies software development, this was my first time doing something video game related. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy what I made!

Some explanation on how my submission is structured:
- the "Tank Game 2021" folder is my Unity project
- the "tank_animated.fbx" file is my textured and animated tank model
- the "Audio" folder contains my Audacity files for my sound effects and the .wav files for my sound effects and background music
- the "Presentation" folder contains the presentation slides and presentation video
- the "Exported Models" folder contains the .fbx files of all my models to be used in the Unity project
- the "Modelling" folder contains all 3DS Max files, texture maps and textures for all my assets
- the "st20211109" file is the same conceptual design file that I submitted on Moodle
